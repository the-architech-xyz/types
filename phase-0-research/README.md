# Phase 0: Research & Prototyping

## Objective
Validate the technical feasibility of The Architech's core automation features before building the full CLI.

## Critical Research Areas

### 1. Shadcn-ui Automation ⚠️ HIGH RISK
**Problem**: Shadcn-ui CLI is interactive by default
**Research Goal**: Prove we can automate shadcn-ui installation and component addition
**Success Criteria**: 
- ✅ Create `components.json` programmatically
- ✅ Run `shadcn-ui add` commands non-interactively
- ✅ Verify components are correctly installed

### 2. Package Manager Agnosticism
**Problem**: Different package managers have different commands and behaviors
**Research Goal**: Create a unified interface that works with npm, yarn, pnpm, and bun
**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Auto-detect available package managers
- ✅ Execute commands correctly for each package manager
- ✅ Handle errors gracefully across all managers

### 3. Cross-Platform Compatibility
**Problem**: Commands behave differently on Windows vs Unix systems
**Research Goal**: Ensure our CLI works on all major platforms
**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Test on macOS, Windows, and Linux
- ✅ Verify path handling works correctly
- ✅ Ensure command execution is consistent

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Test individual components
node phase-0-research/1-shadcn-automation/test-shadcn.js
node phase-0-research/2-package-manager/test-package-managers.js
node phase-0-research/3-cross-platform/test-platform.js

# Or run all tests
npm run test:phase0
```

## Success Metrics

- **Shadcn Automation**: 100% success rate for init + component installation
- **Package Manager Support**: All 4 package managers work identically
- **Platform Compatibility**: Tests pass on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Performance**: Each operation completes within 30 seconds
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failures with clear error messages

## Risk Mitigation

If any component fails validation:
1. **Shadcn fails**: Fall back to manual template creation
2. **Package manager issues**: Focus on npm + yarn for MVP
3. **Platform issues**: Start with Unix systems, add Windows support later

## Next Steps

After Phase 0 validation:
- ✅ Proceed to Phase 1 (CLI Infrastructure)
- 📝 Document findings and update architecture
- 🏗️ Begin implementing validated approaches
