COMPLETE PRODUCT REQUIREMENT DOCUMENT (PRD) FOR THE ARCHITECH
1. Introduction & Vision
	•	Product Name: The Architech	•	Vision Statement: To spark the "Industrial Revolution of Software Development" by shifting the paradigm from manual, repetitive craftsmanship to a modular, intelligent, and automated production line. We empower developers to become architects, freeing them from technical friction to focus on creativity and innovation.	•	Core Problem We Solve (The Developer's Nightmare): Modern software development is broken. Developers waste up to 60% of their time on non-creative tasks like configuration, setup, and infrastructure management. Current AI tools only assist this flawed process, often turning developers into "AI bug-checkers" and removing the joy from the craft.	•	Target Audience (Initial): Experienced full-stack developers, startup founders, and tech leads who feel the pain of building products from scratch and are looking for a massive productivity leap.	•	Key Goals for the POC:
	a.	Prove that a complex, production-ready application can be generated in minutes.	b.	Deliver immediate and undeniable value to our target audience.	c.	Build a robust, open-source foundation that can attract a community and serve as the base for future commercial features.
2. Product Principles (Our Guiding Philosophy)
	•	Developer Experience First: The CLI must be fast, intuitive, and visually satisfying to use. It should feel like a superpower.	•	Modular by Default: The core architectural principle is modularity. The generated code and the tool itself must reflect this.	•	Opinionated but Extensible: We provide a highly opinionated set of "best practices" out of the box, but the architecture must be designed to be extensible with new modules and agents in the future.	•	No Vendor Lock-in: The generated code is standard, clean, and 100% owned by the user. The tool should be a liberator, not a new prison.	•	Start Simple, Scale Infinitely: The POC should be simple and rely on existing, trusted tools. The architecture should be designed to support the long-term vision of true AI agents and a full platform.
3. Core Features & User Stories (POC/MVP)
This section defines the initial user-facing features.
	•	Feature 1: Interactive Project Scaffolding
	▪	User Story: "As a developer, I want to run a single command (⁠npx the-architech create) and answer a few simple questions, so that I can have a fully configured project structure ready in seconds."	▪	Requirements:
	◦	A global CLI command.	◦	Use of ⁠inquirer for interactive prompts (project name, framework choice).	◦	Initial framework support: Next.js with TypeScript.	•	Feature 2: Modular Agent Orchestration
	▪	User Story: "As a developer, I want to select pre-configured modules for common needs (like Authentication or a Design System), so that I don't have to spend days implementing them from scratch."	▪	Requirements:
	◦	An interactive checklist to select modules.	◦	Initial Modules (Agents) for the POC:
	1.	Best Practices Agent: Automatically installs and configures ESLint, Prettier, and Husky for code quality and pre-commit hooks.	2.	Design System Agent: Installs and configures Tailwind CSS and the Shadcn UI library, adding a set of default components (e.g., Button, Card, Input).	3.	Deployment Agent: Generates a multi-stage ⁠Dockerfile optimized for Next.js and a basic CI/CD workflow file for GitHub Actions.	4.	(Future modules will include Authentication, Database, Payments, etc.)	•	Feature 3: Tangible, High-Quality Output
	▪	User Story: "As a developer, I want the generated project to be a clean, production-ready codebase, not a black box, so that I can confidently build upon it."	▪	Requirements:
	◦	The CLI must generate a real directory structure with files.	◦	The generated code must be well-organized, commented where necessary, and follow industry best practices.	◦	The output must clearly state what has been done and provide the next steps (⁠cd project-name, ⁠npm install, ⁠npm run dev).
4. Technical Architecture & Stack (The "How")
	•	CLI Stack:
	▪	Language: Node.js	▪	Libraries: ⁠commander for command parsing, ⁠inquirer for prompts, ⁠chalk and ⁠ora for a beautiful UI, and crucially, ⁠execa to reliably run external shell commands.	•	Generation Strategy (for the POC):
	▪	The core strategy is the orchestration of existing, trusted CLIs and tools.	▪	The "Base Project Agent" will execute ⁠npx create-next-app.	▪	The "Design System Agent" will execute ⁠npx shadcn-ui.	▪	The "Best Practices Agent" will execute ⁠npm install and copy pre-made configuration files from a ⁠templates directory.	•	Generated Project Structure:
	▪	The generated code should follow a mono repo-style structure, even for a single application, to prepare for future scalability.	▪	Example:
project-name/
├── apps/
│   └── web/          # The Next.js application
├── packages/
│   ├── ui/           # Shared React components (from Shadcn)
│   └── config/       # Shared configurations (ESLint, etc.)
└── package.json      # Root package.json
	•	Extensibility: While not in the POC, the CLI should be structured with an ⁠agents directory, making it clear that new agents for other modules or frameworks can be added in the future.
5. User Experience (UX) & Design
	•	The "Magic Moment": The entire CLI experience should be designed to create a "wow" moment. The user should feel like they are interacting with a powerful, intelligent system.	•	Feedback is Key: Provide constant feedback with spinners, progress bars, and clear success/error messages.	•	Future GUI Vision: The long-term vision is a desktop/web application with a visual, modular interface where users can drag, drop, and connect modules. The CLI is the first step and the engine that will power this future GUI.
6. Roadmap (From POC to Scale-up)
	•	POC (Current Goal): A functional open-source CLI with the core agents (Base Project, Best Practices, Design System, Deployment) based on templates and CLI orchestration. Goal: Prove the value and build a community.	•	MVP (Next Step): Introduce a conversational AI layer to guide the user in their choices, and a web-based Project Dashboard to visualize the generated project's modules and connections. Goal: Validate the commercial potential.	•	Scale-up Vision: Evolve towards true specialized AI agents, the full visual GUI (the "IDE killer"), the Marketplace for third-party agents, and the full platform for managing the entire product lifecycle. Goal: Revolutionize the industry.
