# The Architech - Design Choices & Rationale

## Architectural Decisions

### 1. Agent-Based Architecture

**Decision**: Use specialized agents instead of monolithic execution engine.

**Rationale**:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each agent handles one domain (framework, database, auth, etc.)
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new agents without modifying existing code
- **Maintainability**: Changes to one domain don't affect others
- **Testability**: Each agent can be tested independently
- **Future-Proofing**: V2 AI integration will be easier with clear agent boundaries

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Monolithic executor: Rejected due to complexity and coupling
- Plugin system: Rejected as overkill for V1
- Direct adapter execution: Rejected due to lack of validation and coordination

### 2. Declarative YAML Recipes

**Decision**: Use YAML files as the single source of truth for project definition.

**Rationale**:
- **Human-Readable**: Easy to understand and modify
- **Version Control Friendly**: Can be tracked in Git
- **Declarative**: Describes "what" not "how"
- **Portable**: Can be shared across teams and projects
- **AI-Friendly**: Easy for AI to generate and modify

**Alternatives Considered**:
- JSON: Rejected due to lack of comments and verbosity
- TypeScript config: Rejected as too complex for V1
- Interactive CLI: Rejected as not reproducible

### 3. Three-Tier Adapter System

**Decision**: Use three types of adapters: Agnostic, Dependent, and Integration.

**Rationale**:
- **Agnostic Adapters**: Technology-agnostic, can work with any framework
- **Dependent Adapters**: Framework-specific, inherently tied to specific technologies
- **Integration Adapters**: Cross-adapter integrations using "Requester-Provider" pattern
- **Clear Separation**: Each type has distinct responsibilities and naming conventions
- **Maintainability**: Changes to one adapter type don't affect others
- **Community**: Easy for community to contribute all types of adapters

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Single adapter type: Rejected due to complexity in handling framework-specific vs agnostic
- Two-tier system: Rejected as insufficient for cross-adapter integrations
- Plugin system: Rejected as overkill for V1

### 4. Requester-Provider Naming Convention

**Decision**: Use "Requester-Provider" pattern for integration naming.

**Rationale**:
- **Clear Intent**: Immediately understand what the integration does
- **Logical Grouping**: Related integrations are grouped together
- **Discoverability**: Easy to find integrations for specific adapters
- **Consistency**: Same pattern across all integrations
- **User Mental Model**: Matches how developers think about integrations

**Examples**:
- `stripe-nextjs-integration` - Stripe needs Next.js integration
- `web3-shadcn-integration` - Web3 needs Shadcn UI integration
- `drizzle-nextjs-integration` - Drizzle needs Next.js integration

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Alphabetical ordering: Rejected as less logical
- Provider-Requester: Rejected as less intuitive
- Generic naming: Rejected as unclear

### 5. CLI-First Blueprint Approach

**Decision**: Prioritize CLI commands over custom file operations in blueprints.

**Rationale**:
- **Leverage Existing Tools**: Use battle-tested tools like `create-next-app`
- **Reduced Maintenance**: Less custom code to maintain
- **Better Error Handling**: CLI tools have robust error handling
