# The Architech - Wizard of Oz Demo

A visually impressive CLI demo that simulates "The Architech" - a revolutionary AI-powered application generator. This demo creates a "magic moment" by showing weeks of development work being completed in seconds.

## 🎭 What is this?

This is a "Wizard of Oz" demo that simulates an AI system generating complete, modular software applications. It demonstrates:

- **Interactive CLI experience** with colorful output and animations
- **Simulated AI agents** working on different modules
- **Real file generation** with actual project structure
- **Professional visual effects** using spinners and progress bars

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 14.0.0 or higher
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. **Clone or download this repository**
2. **Install dependencies:**

- **DevOpsAgent**: Docker configuration, CI/CD pipeline, monitoring

### Step 4: File Generation
- Progress bars for file generation and dependency installation
- Actual creation of project directory structure
- Template files with realistic content

### Step 5: Success Report
- Comprehensive generation statistics
- Time savings comparison
- Next steps for the user

## 📁 Generated Project Structure

The demo creates a real project with:

```
project-name/
├── package.json          # Project configuration
